# Password Purgatory for .NET

This is Troy Hunt's [Password Purgatory](https://www.troyhunt.com/building-password-purgatory-with-cloudflare-pages-and-workers/), rewritten as a .NET set of applications published to Azure.

> This is not a 1:1 conversation of Troy's code, but many of the original features are present. Particularly the password check regex and messages, so that the end user experience is identical.
